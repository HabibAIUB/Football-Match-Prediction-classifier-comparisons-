# Football-Match-Prediction-classifier-comparisons-

## Project Description

This repository contains the implementation of a football match prediction classifier. The goal of this project is to predict the outcome of football matches using various machine learning classifiers.

## Classifiers Used

We have used the following classifiers for predictions and compared their results:

1. **Random Forest**
2. **Gradient Boosting**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**

## Feature Engineering

Before applying the classifiers, we performed feature engineering to prepare our dataset for machine learning. The feature engineering process involved:

- **Data Cleaning**: We cleaned our data by handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Selection**: We selected the most relevant features that contribute to the outcome of a football match.

## Results

The results of our classifiers are compared based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Detailed results and comparison metrics can be found in the Jupyter notebooks associated with each classifier.

## Future Work

We plan to incorporate more classifiers and use ensemble methods to improve the prediction accuracy. We also aim to continuously update our dataset with recent football matches to keep our predictions up-to-date.
